# medusa-payment-mercadopago

Add MercadoPago as a Payment Provider.

## NOTICE: THIS PACKAGE DOESN'T ACTUALLY WORK
I've managed to implement correctly most of the required functions, but currently have no time to invest in making this 100% functional.

Feel free to submit a pull request if u want.

## Options

```js
{
  access_token: "MERCADOPAGO_ACCESS_TOKEN",
}
```
